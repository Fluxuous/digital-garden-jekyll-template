# Hello, I'm Parker Ferguson

I'm a technology leader and consultant specializing in fintech, generative AI, and cryptocurrency systems. With over 15 years of experience building and scaling products and engineering teams, I help organizations navigate complex technological challenges and drive innovation.

## My Journey
My career has taken me through diverse roles across the financial technology landscape. I've had the privilege of working with quantitative hedge funds, cryptocurrency platforms, and financial exchanges, giving me a unique perspective on how technology transforms finance.

After earning my Bachelor of Music in Music Business and Entrepreneurship from Berklee College of Music, I followed my passion for technology and finance, eventually becoming a CTO at ACE Portal in association with the New York Stock Exchange.

## Professional Experience
I've held leadership positions at several notable organizations:

Two Sigma: As VP of Product, I directed Trading Platform Engineering and High Frequency Market Data product management for this $60 billion AUM quantitative hedge fund.
CoinDesk: During my tenure as VP of Operations and VP of Technology and Product Development, I grew the product team from 1 to 25 members and helped scale web traffic from 1 million to 28 million unique visitors monthly.
Qineqt: As SVP Engineering, I led the technical organization behind a quantamental data platform for hedge funds, managing 50 team members across three time zones.
Since 2009, I've also worked as an independent consultant, helping asset managers, Fortune 50 companies, private equity firms, and startups with engineering, product, and operational challenges.
